The A-4E mod is based on a Rafale M mod. Things that are called "Rafale-something" are bits that haven't been changed yet, and should at some point.

All the animations for the external model are done. However, these animations are for AI PLANES ONLY.

Once you add a human cockpit, all theses animations stop playing, and need to be explicitly coded, usually through calling their arguments.
The arguments list can be found on the Google Drive, in Development Support DCS/Draw Arguments/aircrafts 1.1

The advantage of calling the arguments in code is that you can specify the time needed to play them (ex: extend the gear in 7 seconds, but retract it in 10 seconds)

Note that these are ONLY ANIMATIONS. They're just for show, and don't do ANYTHING on the flight model or the way the aicraft behaves. Extending airbrakes won't slow you down, etc.
Their effects need to be added. You'll have to find out how.




You can both see the placehold internal cockpit and the external cockpit. I know. I'm going to fix that. 




Annotations may be in english, russian or french. In 95% of the cases, google translate will be good enough for translating the russian and french. If you have a doubt, just send me a message on Discord, user name is : kryb
