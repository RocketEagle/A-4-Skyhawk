-- "continuous" flaps behavior, dofile() via flaps.lua
--
-- behavior documentation: NAVAIR 01-40AVC-1 section 1-30, 15 July 1969, "WING FLAPS"
-- flap blowback begins at 230kts IAS to prevent structural damage
--
-- design summary:
--   single key press for Up/Down starts motion, and a 2nd keypress of any flap command stops movement of the flaps
--   flaps takeoff command will begin a movement towards 50% extension as a shortcut
--   full extension (100%) through full retraction (0%)
--   executing Flaps Up/Down command moves to the other extreme position, alternate direction on next movement
--   if flaps were stopped manually, next Flaps Up/Down will continue in the direction they were moving before the stop
