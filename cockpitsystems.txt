12 March 2016


We are going to try to implement an A-4E as documented in NAVAIR
01-40AVC-1, "NATOPS Flight Manual, Navy Model, A-4E/F Aircraft" last
changed 15 November 1970.

This document is on our HoggitDev Share google drive, with the name
A4G_NATOPS_Text_Searchable+BookMarks.pdf in the "Documentation/doc"
folder.


As this is a combined NAVAIR document, the listed AFC (Airframe
Change) numbers are possible upgrades for both E and F airplanes.

List that we ARE implementing:

* 200 - Radar Altimeter & Bearing Distance Heading Indicator - Inst Panel (30+39)
* 202 - Air Refueling Probe Light - RH Wedge Console (47)
* 204 - Canopy Jettison System - RH Side Cockpit

* 356 - IFF MODE 4 Failure Light - RH Glareshield
* 359 - Escapac I Zero-Zero Escape System - Cockpit
* 376 - Full Shrike System Early A-4E - Armament Panel (35)
* 382 - Exhaust Smoke Abatement - LH Wedge Console (15)
* 386 - Shrike Improved Display System (SIDS) (?)
* 387 - Radar Control Console (6?)
* 395 - Improved Walleye Display (?)
* 400 - J52-P-8A Engine Installation - Cockpit Placard
* 418-II - AN/ALE Chaff Dispenser - LH Glareshield
* 428 - Instrument Panel Lighting Control - Wiring/Control mod (54)
* 429 - Nosewheel Steering, reason: A-4F only, but built into the SFM
* 430 - Cockpit Landing Checklist Panel - LH Inst Panel (below 42)
* 442 - Wing Lift Spoilers - Throttle Quad. (16A)
* 451 - Gunsight, Adjustment Knob Assembly - Center Glareshield
* 451-I - Interchange Angle-of-Attack Indexer and Accelerometer - Inst Panel (18/42)
* 456 - Angle-of-Attack Indexer - Above Glareshield (18?/42?)

List that we are modeling in the cockpit, but likely non-functional:

* 213 - JATO Provisions - Throttle Quadrant (17)
- shrike support
- ground radar support

List of official modifications we are NOT implementing in our specific A-4E:

* 360-1 - Upper Avionics Compartment - LH Glareshield, reason: already have AFC 325
* 473 - AN/APN-154(V) Radar Beacon - LH Console, reason: no info


List of official modifications we would have no way of noticing:

* 230 - Horizontal Stabilizer Nose Down Incidence - Wiring/System Mod
* 258 - AJB-3/A Lof Bomb ON/OFF Switch (Gyro Cutout Switch) - Wiring Mod
* 270A - Fuel Boost Pump Circuit Wiring - Wiring Mod
* 331 - Improved Air Bleed System for Air Turbine Transfer Pump - N/A
* 394-I/II/III/IV - Supplement ECM - Wiring/Control Mod.
* 423 - Disable LAWS Unreliability Tone with APR-27 Installed - N/A
* 464 - AXC-666 Air Data Computer Wiring - wiring mod
* 315 - Two Point Oil Quantity Indicating System - Inst Panel (?)


Cockpit Decisions to make:

#256 - Bullpup Adaptive Control - LH Console

       if we implement:
       - panel 7 becomes ARN-77 Control Selector (was panel #6 Radar Control Panel)
       - panel 51 becomes AFCS Test Switch Panel (was Spare Lamps Container)
       - panel 52 becomes Compass Control Panel (was AFCS Test Switch Panel)
       - panel 55 becomes IFF Control Panel (was Compass Control Panel)
       - panel 56 becomes Radar Control Panel (was IFF Control Panel)

       *NOTE: Panel 6 affected by #387 below too!

#376 - Full Shrike System Early A-4E - Armament Panel

       if we implement:
       - panel 2 becomes Weapon Control Panel (was blank)
       - panel 3 becomes blank (was LABS Control Panel)

       *NOTE: are LABS and Shrike mutually exclusive?

#387 - Radar Control Console

       if we implement:
       - panel 6 becomes Radar Control Console, unless we also
         have #256 above, in which case Radar Control Console
         moves to panel 56 position

"Late A-4E"

       if we implement:
       - button/light 23 becomes oil quantity indicator switch (#315?)
       - gauge 31 becomes blank (was dead reckoning indicator)
       - panel 37 becomes Aircraft Weapons Release Systems Panel (otherwise N/A)
       - panel 50 at top left (ASN-41 Doppler Nav Computer) (otherwise ASN-19)
       - panel 49/49A late configuration w/ spare lamps

Buddy Refueling

       if we implement:
       - need to place the refueling control panel per PDF page 687
         (FO-3) into maybe position 3?  Without this panel, there's no
         point in implementing the D-704 buddy refueling pod.
